# Experiments_Abhi
This is basically a card game which is named as Black-Jack Game. The game is made using Python. I made this game mainly to understand the modules and functions of python.
It runs on a Graphical User Interface system and is developed using the "tkinter" module of Python library. 
There might be some issues while you are running this program on your system because I have not committed the images on GitHub which I have used in this program.
Hope you guys like this small project.
